# Assignment 1 - Graphs

Given a directed acyclic graph G = (V, E) and a vertex u, design an algorithm that outputs all vertices S \subseteq V such that for all v \in S, there is an even length simple path from u to v in G. (A simple path is a path will all distinct vertices)

#### Running the code (/src folder)

    ```bash
    ./compile.sh
    ```

2. To run - 

    ```bash
    ./run.sh <input> <output>
